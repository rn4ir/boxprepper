#### An Ansible playbook to quickly set up and secure CentOS and Debian boxes (*wip*)
 
This playbook created as a means to quickly set up , configure and secure a CentOS/Debian  
as soon as the OS installation is complete.  
  
Here're a couple articles that outlines the manual steps, based on which this playbook was written:
1. [Securing a new Linux Box - Part 1](https://muchbits.com/secure-linux-box-1.html)  
2. [Securing a new Linux Box - Part 2](https://muchbits.com/secure-linux-box-2.html)  
  
*TODO:*  

- Add logwatch installation (*if required*)  
- 2-Factor Authentication (*if required*)
